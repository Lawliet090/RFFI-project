RFFI project: Optimize energy consumption in Kongsvinger
This project explores how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to optimize energy consumption and improve the efficiency of existing power grids. The aim is to enable smarter energy use, support the integration of renewable energy sources, and promote flexible grid operations.

The work is motivated by the ongoing energy shortage in Kongsvinger, Innlandet (Norway), which affects local industrial development and climate goals. With growing electricity demand and an increasing share of renewables, optimizing grid performance is essential.

The project is divided into two parts:

Prediction Model: Implemented in Python (.ipynb), this model uses AI techniques to forecast energy demand and improve load balancing.

Scenario Simulation: Implemented in NetLogo, an agent-based model simulates different energy usage scenarios to test how the system responds under varying conditions.

The project demonstrates how AI can help reduce grid overload, enhance reliability, and support a low-carbon energy future. It also looks at local solutions like hydropower and energy-from-waste as part of the energy mix.

Note: The dataset used in this project is confidential and cannot be shared.
